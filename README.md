# An Experimental Application of Unsupervised Learning to Chatbots
### by Chris Varga and Nicholas Marble

Chatbots are computer programs designed to emulate an intelligent conversation that is indistinguishable to what a human could provide. They are used for a multitude of functions from technical assistance to personal companionships. A large variety of these chatbots use large databases with collected hard coded answers or attempt to learn proper answers through some sort of supervised machine learning. These approaches can sometimes create reasonable but unhuman-like responses. We propose to instead use actual human responses derived from Twitter to simulate a more human grammar.
